# Skip-Bo #

### Group 2E ###

This is the final project in Intermediate Programming (600.120) at Johns Hopkins University.
The collaborators are:
	
* Hugh Han 		(hhan17@jhu.edu)
* SeungHwan Lee 	(slee385@jhu.edu)
* Marc Feldman		(mfeldm21@jhu.edu)
* Matthew Cowen-Green	(mcoweng1@jhu.edu)

This project creates a game of Skip-Bo.

### Usage ###

To compile and run the program:
```$ make```

To compile and run the tests:
```$ make test```

To remove executable files:
```$ make clean```

### What does the project have? ###

* We have a working Text UI, and we attempted to create a heuristic AI. We commented out the code for the heuristic AI, because it sometimes causes a segmentation fault (randomly). We believe the reason for this is because in our code, we recursively prompt the computer for its input. Using it heuristic AI, it may think too many times before finding a valid move and this will cause an overflow error.
* Other than occasional segmentation faults using the extra credit code, there are no known errors.

### Questions? ###

* Feel free to contact any team member using the emails above.
